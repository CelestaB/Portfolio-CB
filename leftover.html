      <h4>The Problem</h4>
      <p>We are working to reduce the amount of food waste, created by restaurants specifically, in addition to
        providing affordable meals to the local
        community.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="textBody">
      <h4>The Solution</h4>
      <p>We created an app that notifies health and budget-conscious people when a restaurant is about to
        throw away edible, excess food.</p>

      <p>For this project, we were assigned the task of coming up with an idea for an app and then executing the initial
        research and design needed to back our concept. We wanted the app to be useful in our community and affect
        change
        in someway. After throwing around some ideas, we landed on the concept of Leftover Rescue. It would be an app
        that local restaurants could use to list food at
        the end of the night that would otherwise be wasted at a discounted price.
        Our aim was to focus on college students and lower income individuals who would benefit from a low-budget meal
        that was not neceassarily fast-food, and reduce food waste at the same time. Once we hashed out the details of
        what exactly we wanted the app to do, we began user research to see exactly who would use/benefit most from the
        app. From there, we continued to narrow our ideas on to what would truly be pheasible and ended up with a few
        beginning versions of our prototype.

            <h6 class="font-weight-normal">As stated above, once the concept was decided we began with our user
              research. We had many grandious ideas for our initial concept which meant it would target a variety of
              different demographics.Through our findings, however, we needed to narrow down
              the user to a specific individual. We were continually reminded throughout our process that you must start
              with precise ideas and then as the company grows; those ideas can be implimented.</p>

            <h6 class="font-weight-normal"> After we had a focused idea of who we were creating the app for, it was much
              easier to work through the definition phase. I took the lead on the competitive analysis. The most
              blantant discovery I found was that there were no competitors in our area. While there were apps that had
              the same idea most were in Europe or large metropolitan areas. Due to that fact, we were able to gain a
              lot of ideas from what works well for them and indiviualize them to fit our needs.

            <h6 class="font-weight-normal"> The protoryping phase is always my favorite. It's gratifying to finally see
              a product come to life. We tested a few differnt prototypes starting with very lo-fi and working our way
              through
              some A/B testing to create higher-fidelity options. Through testing we found that our colors were
              not color compliant, as well as, where each button was most effective.
